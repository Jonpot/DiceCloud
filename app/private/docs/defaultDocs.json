When an action is taken, all the properties under it are applied.\n\nAdd actions to your character sheet, then add children under the action to determine what happenes when the action is applied.\n\nWhen an action is applied it will create an entry in the character's log detailing all the properties that were applied and what their results were.\n\nSee [Static and Activated Properties](https://dicecloud.com/docs/concepts/static-and-activated-properties) for more information on what properties can be applied by actions.\n\n---\n\n### Name\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">name</code>\n\nThe name of the action.\n\n### Action type\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">actionType</code>\n\nHow long the action takes to perform.\n\nAllows [inline calculations](/docs/concepts/inline-calculations).\n\n### Variable name\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">variableName</code>\n\nFor Event-type actions, the variable name to use when referencing this event.\n\n### Attack roll\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">attackRoll</code>\n\nA [computed field](/docs/concepts/computed-fields) which calculates the attack roll modifier. If this field is empty, no attack roll will be made. Use 0 to make an attack roll without a modifier.\n\nThe following variables may be added to the action scope when attack rolls are made:\n\n  - `~attackDiceRoll` The value of the d20 roll before any modifiers were applied.\n  - `~attackRoll` The total attack roll after modifiers.\n  - `~criticalHit` Set to `true` if the attack roll's d20 is a natural 20. If `~criticalHitTarget` is set, the attack roll's d20 must instead be equal to or greater than `~criticalHitTarget` for this to be set to `true`.\n  - `~criticalMiss` Set to `true` if the attack roll was not a critical hit and rolled a natural 1 on the d20 roll.\n  - `~attackHit` If the attack roll is higher than or equal to the target's AC or a critical hit this is set to `true`. Remains unset if there is no target for the attack unless the attack is a critical hit.\n  - `~attackMiss` If the attack roll is lower than the target's AC or a critical miss, this is set to `true`. Remains unset if there is no target for the attack unless the attack is a critical miss.\n - `~attackAdvantage` If the attack roll is made with Advantage, this is set to `1`. If the attack roll is made with Disadvantage, this is set to `-1`. Remains unset if the attack was made normally.\n\n### Summary\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">summary</code>\n\nA brief overview of what the action does.

If the resource attribute is less than the amount required, the action can't be applied.\n\nIf you want to reduce an attribute when taking the action, but want the action to be applied regardless of the value of that attribute, consider using an [Attribute Damage](/docs/property/attribute-damage) property as a child of the action instead. Also use Attribute Damage when the amount to reduce the attribute is determined by a dice roll rather than a stable computed number.\n\n#### Resource attribute\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">resources.attributesConsumed.0.variableName</code>\n\nThe variable name of the attribute that will be consumed when taking this action.\n\n#### Resource quantity\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">resources.attributesConsumed.0.quantity</code>\n\nA [computed field](/docs/concepts/computed-fields) which determines how much of the attribute is required to apply this action. This amount will be deducted from the attribute every time the action is taken.\n\n### Ammo\n\nAmmo represents items that are required to take the action. If an item is not selected, or there is insufficient quantity of the selected item, the action can't be applied.\n\n#### Ammo item\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">resources.itemsConsumed.0.tag</code>\n\nSpecify what tag an item must have to be considered valid ammo for this action. Any item with this tag can be selected as ammo for this action.\n\n#### Ammo quantity\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">resources.itemsConsumed.0.quantity</code>\n\nA [computed field](/docs/concepts/computed-fields) which determines how many of the selected items are required to take this action. The quantity is deducted from the total quantity of the item when this action is applied.\n\n### Target\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">target</code>\n\nWho this action should apply to. The properties under the action will be applied to the Targets.\n\n- **Self** The action will apply its properties to the creature taking the action\n- **Single Target** The action will apply its properties without a target (for now)\n- **Multiple Targets** The action will apply its properties without a target (for now)\n\n### Uses\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">uses</code>\n\nA [computed field](/docs/concepts/computed-fields) which determines how many times this action can be used before it needs to be reset.\n\n### Uses used\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">usesUsed</code>\n\nHow many of this action's uses have already been used.

    "description": "Attributes represent the basic numerical values of the creature, including everything from stats to health bars and more. The are the most common targets for [effects](/docs/property/effect), which affect them with a static bonus.\n\nAttributes have the following fields that can be accessed in calculations with `variableName.field`:\n\n- `total` - The default value of the attribute before being damaged.\n- `value` - The current value of the attribute including damage. `variableName` and `variableName.value` are equivalent.\n- `damage` - The amount of damage the attribute has taken.\n- `modifier` - If the attribute's type is Ability Score, its corresponding modifier in D&D 5th Edition rules.\n\n---\n\n### Name\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">name</code>\n\nThe human-readable name of the attribute.\n\n### Variable name\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">variableName</code>\n\nThe name used to refer to the attribute in calculations and by effects. Must start with a letter and be made up of only letters and numbers without spaces, symbols, or punctuation.\n\nIf multiple attributes share a variable name, only the last attribute on the [character tree](/docs/concepts/tree) will count as the defining attribute and appear on the sheet, while other attributes with that variable name will be used as base value [effects](/docs/property/effect).\n\n### Base value\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">baseValue</code>\n\nA [computed field](/docs/concepts/computed-fields) that determines the starting value of the attribute before it is modified by effects and other properties. Multiple properties can set the base value for a given variable name, when this happens the highest base value is chosen, and then all other effects are applied.\n\n### Attribute type\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">attributeType</code>\n\n- **Ability** - Ability scores like Strength, Dexterity, etc. Ability scores get a modifier which can be accessed in calculations as `variableName.modifier`.\n- **Stat** - Any simple numerical value that appears on the sheet, e.g. speed, armor class.\n- **Modifier** - Any numerical value that appears on the sheet with a `+` or `-` sign, e.g. proficiency bonus.\n- **Hit Dice** - Hit dice let you select the appropriate hit dice size. Creatures regain half their total hit dice on long rest by default.\n- **Health Bar** - Health bars can be made to take or ignore damage in a specified order.\n- **Resource** - Rages, sorcery points, things that are spent to use actions.\n- **Spell Slot** - Spell slots have a specific level and are used to cast spells.\n- **Utility** - Utility attributes don't show up anywhere on the sheet, but can still be used for calculations.\n\n### Description\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">description</code>\n\nA detailed description of the attribute.

A lower ordered health bar will take damage before a higher ordered one.\n\nHealth bars can also change color depending on their value. At 50%+ full they are their property color, between 50% and 0% they fade from their half-full color to their empty color.\n\n##### Health Bar Fields\n- `healthBarColorMid` The color when below half health.\n- `healthBarColorLow` The color when empty.\n- `healthBarNoDamage` If true, this health bar will ignore damage.\n- `healthBarNoHealing` If true, this health bar will ignore healing.\n- `healthBarNoDamageOverflow` If true, this health bar will not allow excess damage to overflow past it.\n- `healthBarNoHealingOverflow` If true, this health bar will not allow excess healing to overflow past it.\n- `healthBarDamageOrder` The numeric priority with which damage will apply to this health bar.\n- `healthBarHealingOrder` The numeric priority with which healing will apply to this health bar.\n\n### Hit dice size\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">hitDiceSize</code>\n\nHit dice can come in various sizes, from d4 to d20.\n\n### Spell slot level\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">spellSlotLevel</code>\n\nSpell slots require a level, to determine what levels of spells they can be used to cast.\n\n### Damage\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">damage</code>\n\nThe amount of damage this attribute has currently taken. Subtracted from `.total` to calculate `.value`.\n\n### Reset\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">reset</code>\n\nIf set, the damage on this attribute is reset to 0 at the appropriate time.\n\n- **Long rest** - Reset when the long rest button is pushed\n- **Short rest** - Reset when either the long or short rest button is pushed\n\n### Allow decimal values\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">decimal</code>\n\nIf this is set, the attribute will not round-down when its value has a decimal.\n\n### Can be damaged into negative values\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">ignoreLowerBound</code>\n\nIf this is set the attribute can be damaged past zero into negative values.\n\n### Can be incremented above total\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">ignoreUpperBound</code>\n\nIf this is set the attribute can have negative damage such that the value exceeds the total. This can be useful if you are using the attribute to count, it can start at zero and be healed upwards to keep count.\n\n### Hide when total is zero\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">hideWhenTotalZero</code>\n\nIf this is set, the attribute will not be displayed on the sheet when its value before damage is 0.\n\n### Hide when value is zero\n<code style=\"position:relative;float:right;top:-3em;font-size:12px\">hideWhenValueZero</code>\n\nIf this is set, the attribute will not be displayed on the sheet when its value after damage is 0.",

Avoid adding dice rolls to calculations that expect to resolve down to a number, because they will re-roll every time the creature is recalculated, causing instability in the creature's stats.\n\n## Parser\n\nThe DiceCloud parser can understand the following syntax:\n\n|  |  |\n| :- | :- |\n| **Numbers** | `13`, `3.14` |\n| **Dice rolls** | `3d6`, `(1 + 2)d4`|\n| **Strings of text** | `'Some text'`, `\"some other text\"` |\n| **Boolean values** | `true` or `false`. When DiceCloud expects a boolean, `0`, an empty string `''` and `false` are all considered false by DiceCloud's engine, every other value is considered true. |\n| **Variable names** | `variableName` |\n| **Addition and subtraction** | `1 + 2 + 3`, `12 - 6` |\n| **Multiplication** | `6 * 4`, `12 * 2` = `24` |\n| **Division** | `6 / 2`, `12 / 4` = `3` |\n| **Exponents** | `3 ^ 2` Raise 3 to the power of 2 |\n| **Modulo** | Returns the remainder of a division operation `15 % 6` = `3` |\n| **AND** | `&` or `&&`: Returns the value of the right hand side if the left side is true `true & 'cat'` = `'cat'` |\n| **OR** | <code>&vert;</code> or <code>&vert;&vert;</code>: Returns the left hand side if it is true, otherwise returns the right hand side <code>'dog' &vert;&vert; 'cat'</code> = `'dog'` |\n| **NOT** | `!` returns false if the value after it is true, otherwise returns false  |\n| **Comparisons** | greater than: `>`, less than: `<`, greater than or equal to: `>=`, less than or equal to: `<=`, equal: `=` or `==` or `===`, not equal: `!=` or `!==` |\n| **If-else** | `condition ? resultIfTrue : resultIfFalse`, `level > 10 ? 'high tier' : 'low tier'` |\n| **Arrays** | lists of values `[3, 6, 9, 12]`. |\n| **Array Indexes** | A value can be chosen from an array using another set of square brackets: `[3, 6, 9, 12][2]` = `[6]` because `[2]` fetches the 2nd value in the array. Arrays start at 1 in DiceCloud so that level tables can have 20 entries and be accessed by `array[level]`. |\n| **Function calls** | `functionName(argument1, argument1)` See [Functions](/docs/concepts/functions) for a full list of available functions. |\n\n## Special variables\n\n### Built-in variables\n\nThese variables are added to the creature automatically when relevant. They can be overridden if needed by creating a property with the same variable name. They can also be targeted by effects.\n\n- `xp` - A total of all the experiences with xp added to the character sheet\n- `milestoneLevels` - A total of all the experiences with milestone levels added to the character sheet\n- `itemsAttuned` - Number of items the creature is attuned to\n- `weightEquipment` - Total weight of all equipment on the creature\n- `valueEquipment` - Total value of all equipment on the creature\n- `weightTotal` - Total weight of the creature's entire inventory\n- `valueTotal` - Total value of the creature's entire inventory\n- `weightCarried` - Total weight of all carried items and containers\n- `valueCarried` - Total value of all carried items and containers\n- `level` - The current level of the creature, including all class levels\n- `~criticalHitTarget` - Defaults to 20, the natural roll needed to consider an attack roll as a critical hit\n\n### Pseudo built-in variables\n\nThese variables are not created automatically, but are assumed to exist by various parts of the system. Your sheet won't break if they don't exist, but some things may not work as expected out of the box.\n\n- `proficiencyBonus` - The level-based bonus to add to your attacks, checks, and saves when proficiency is applicable.\n  - Skills use `proficiencyBonus` to define their modifier by default, by multiplying it with their `proficiency` field.\n  - Setting a spellcasting ability on a Spell List will autofill the Attack Roll Bonus and DC fields with a formula including `proficiencyBonus`.\n\n### Action variables\n\nThese variables are available during an action after the relevant property has been applied. For Advanced users, a [Roll](/docs/property/roll) can set these variables, overriding the default behavior.\n\n#### [Actions](/docs/property/action)\n\n- `~attackDiceRoll` - The value of the d20 roll before any modifiers were applied.\n- `~attackRoll` - The total attack roll after modifiers.\n- `~criticalHit` - Set to `true` if the attack roll's d20 is a natural 20. If `~criticalHitTarget` is set, the attack roll's d20 must instead be equal to or greater than `~criticalHitTarget` for this to be set to `true`.\n- `~criticalMiss` - Set to `true` if the attack roll was not a critical hit and rolled a natural 1 on the d20 roll.\n- `~attackHit` - If the attack roll is higher than or equal to the target's AC or a critical hit this is set to `true`. Remains unset if there is no target for the attack unless the attack is a critical hit.\n- `~attackMiss` - If the attack roll is lower than the target's AC or a critical miss, this is set to `true`. Remains unset if there is no target for the attack unless the attack is a critical miss.\n\n#### [Spells](/docs/property/spell)\n\n- `slotLevel` - The level at which the spell was cast, from 0 to 9.\n\nSpells can also use any of the variables from Actions if they're set to have an attack roll.\n\n#### [Skills](/docs/property/skill)\n\n- `~checkDiceRoll` - The value of the d20 roll before any modifiers were applied.\n- `~checkRoll` - The total check result after modifiers.\n\nNote that since Skills don't directly activate their children, these variables are only accessible by using a [Trigger](/docs/property/trigger) with the Roll Check event.\n\n#### [Damage](/docs/property/damage)\n\n- `~lastDamageType` - The type of damage dealt last, any damage that has the `extra` type will use this damage type instead\n\n#### [Saving throws](/docs/property/saving-throw)\n\n- `~saveFailed` - Set to `true` if the target failed its saving throw or there are no targets for the saving throw\n- `~saveSucceeded` - Set to `true` if the target made its saving throw or there are no targets for the saving throw\n- `~saveDiceRoll` - The unmodified d20 roll the target made to save\n- `~saveRoll` - The final value of the saving throw roll after modifiers\n\n## Ancestor references\n\nThe ancestors of a property can be accessed directly using the `#ancestorType` syntax. For example, a spell might need to know the save DC of the spell list that it is inside of, which can be accessed with `#spellList.dc`.\n\nTriggers and their children work differently: They don't have access to their own ancestors, but rather inherit the ancestors of the property that caused them to fire. For example, a trigger at the root of the creature's tree might be fired by a spell being cast, you can still use references to ancestors like `#spellList.attackRollBonus` inside that trigger as if it were under the spell itself."

    "description": "When a variable is referenced in a calculation, that calculation can be said to depend on that variable. In order for the calculation to compute, the value of the variable needs to be known.\n\nBut consider the following property values that could be added to a creature\n\n- The creature's Strength base value is set to `dexterity + 1` so that it will always have 1 more strength than dexterity\n- The creature's Dexterity base value is set to `constitution + 1` so that it will always have 1 more dexterity than constitution\n- The creature's Constitution base value is set to `strength` so that its constitution is always equal to its strength\n\nIt is not possible to resolve these calculations, not just because no values exist which satisfy the constraints, but because strength depends on dexterity which depends on constitution which depends on strength. None can be computed before the others have finalized their values. This is a dependency loop.\n\nMost dependency loops that appear in actual DiceCloud creatures are less trivial than this example, but they cause the same result: a sheet that can't be accurately computed. In these cases, DiceCloud does its best, chooses an order to resolve the calculations arbitrarily, and continues calculating. An error will show on the Build tab to let you know that something went wrong.\n\n![dependency loop example](/images/docs/dependency-loop.png)\n\n## Toggles\n\nCalculated [Toggles](/docs/property/toggle) are the main source of dependency loops on creatures, because they create a dependency that isn't as obvious as a calculation might be. When a toggle is in calculated mode, its children do not know whether they are active or not until the calculation is resolved. Because of this, every calculation under the toggle depends on the toggle's calculation, making the chance for a loop to be formed more likely the more children are under a toggle.\n\nConsider this example\n\n- A calculated toggle that is active if `strength < 10`\n- An effect under that toggle that adds 2 to `strength`\n\nThe effect can't compute, because it does not know if it is active yet, so the toggle must compute its calculation first. The toggle needs to know if `strength` is greater than 10. Strength depends on all of the effects targeting it, it must know if the +2 effect is active or not. This creates a dependency loop, because there is no valid order in which everything can be calculated.\n\n## Troubleshooting a dependency loop\n\n- First, identify all the properties that make up the dependency loop. These are linked in the dependency loop error message. The field names in square brackets after the property name indicates which calculations on the property are directly involved.\n- Move any properties in the loop out from being children of calculated Toggles\n- Use static values in place of variables where they are not strictly needed\n- Ask for [help](/feedback)"

    "description": "The first thing you'll most likely want to do upon joining DiceCloud is to create a character. To do so, you'll need to head to your character list to create one - use the ☰ button at the top left to open the menu, then click on Characters.\n\nAny time you see a circular red (+) button like below, you can click it to add something new, be it a character, a game statistic, or a note about your adventures. For now, start by clicking on the one on your character list to create a new character.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DozXzBY.png\" style=\"display:block;margin:8px auto\">\n\nOnce you've clicked that button, you should see a dialog that looks like below. Fill out your basic character details like name, alignment, and gender (you can always change these later), then click either Next or Create. \n\nIf you click Next, you'll be given an option to select which libraries you want your character to pull from; you should automatically be subscribed to a library for the freely available SRD materials from D&D 5th Edition, so we'll ignore this step for now. See [Using Libraries](/docs/getting-started/using-libraries) for details on how to get access to materials outside of the 5e SRD.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/arnjWvN.png\" style=\"display:block;margin:8px auto;width:500px\">\n\nNow that your character is created, you can select them from your character list, and you'll be taken to a page that looks like below. This is the Build tab, and is where you'll make most decisions regarding things like your character's ability scores, race, class, and background. By clicking on the cards outlined in red along the top, you can select from the freely available SRD materials to build your character as you see fit; new cards will appear as choices you make require additional detail, such as your class proficiencies or subclass.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3nSL9rJ.png\" style=\"display:block;margin:8px auto;width:500px\">\n\nOnce you've selected your class, you should see a Level Up button appear on the card labeled \"Level\". You can click this button to level your character up when the time comes.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MhuSedn.png\" style=\"display:block;margin:8px auto;\">\n\n---\n<br>\n\nNow that you've filled out your basic character choices, you can start exploring the rest of your character sheet. The tabs along the top each represent a different page, on which you'll find various different pieces of your character's information.\n\n- The Stats tab contains things like your hit points, ability scores, skills, and other similar information. Clicking on most stats or skills will allow you to roll for them, the results of which will show up in the log to the right (if you don't see it, click the button that looks like speech bubbles at the top right of your sheet).\n- The Actions tab contains clickable buttons to activate various abilities your character can use.\n- The Spells tab contains information about your character's spellcasting abilities, if applicable. You can hide it from your sheet if you don't want it by going to the Journal tab, clicking on your character's details, and opening Advanced.\n- The Inventory tab contains information about your character's items and money.\n- The Features tab contains information about what your character can do that's special and unique to them.\n- The Journal tab features your basic character information, and you can also add notes to track various things like your backstory or campaign notes.\n- The Tree tab is hidden by default, and allows advanced users to easily dig into the guts of how their sheet functions. You can enable it from the same place as hiding the Spells tab.\n\nIf you're ever in doubt about how something works, click on it! Most things on your sheet will either do something when clicked, or open up to show more details. Also keep the red (+) buttons in mind; most tabs have one, and clicking on them will allow you to add new things to your sheet depending on which tab you use it from. The best way to learn is by exploring.\n\n---\n<br>\n\n<p style=\"float:right\"><a href=\"/docs/getting-started/using-libraries\">Next: Using Libraries &gt;</a></p>",

    "description": "Libraries are DiceCloud's way of both sharing and reusing user-created materials. \n\nWhen you first create your account, you should be automatically subscribed to a library for the materials freely available in D&D 5th Edition's \"System Reference Document\" (SRD). That library contains a Ruleset which will automatically be installed on new characters, which defines the structure of a character designed for use with that Ruleset - everything from hit points to skills and more. User-created libraries can define alternate Rulesets for 5e or other systems, as well as contain additional materials such as items or classes which can be used with a specific Ruleset.\n\nTo subscribe to a library, click on the link shared with you, then click the “Subscribe” button at the top right of the page.  You can also find a directory of publicly shared, user-created libraries in the [community libraries browser](/community-libraries) or on DiceCloud's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mv93t6QdEN).\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/F4EZJDU.png\" style=\"display:block;margin: 8px auto;width:500px\">\n\nIn order to create a library, you'll need to be a [Patron](https://www.patreon.com/dicecloud) in at least the Adventurer ($5) tier, or be invited by someone of the Hero ($10) tier or higher. You can always use libraries others have created, even without any subscription.\n\n---\n<br>\n\n<p style=\"float:left\"><a href=\"/docs/getting-started/creating-a-character\">&lt; Previous: Creating a Character</a></p>\n<p style=\"float:right\"><a href=\"/docs/getting-started/markdown-basics\">Next: Markdown Basics &gt;</a></p>",

    "description": "DiceCloud uses Github-flavored Markdown for most of its text fields, such as descriptions and summaries. This page gives a quick overview of what you can do with it.\n\n## Inline Calculations\nThe primary feature unique to DiceCloud's version of Markdown is the ability to embed variables and calculations into your text using `{curly braces}`, for example `{8 + proficiencyBonus + charisma.modifier}`. See [Inline Calculations](/docs/concepts/inline-calculations) for more details.\n\n## Inline Text Formatting\n\nSyntax | Result\n:-- | :--\n`*italic*` | *italic*\n`**bold**` | **bold**\n`***bold italic***` | ***bold italic***\n`~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~\n<code>&grave;code&grave;</code> | `code`\n`[Links](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)` | [Links](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\n## Headings\nStarting a line with `#` will create a heading. Adding additional `#`s will reduce the size of the heading in steps, for example `###`.\n\n## Lists\n```\n- Unordered\n- List\n- Items\n\n1. Ordered\n2. List\n3. Items\n```\n\n## Tables\nCreating a table like this, with the arrangement of `:-:` in the second row defining the alignment:\n```\nColumn 1     | Column 2     | Column 3\n:--          | :-:          | --:\nLeft-aligned | Centered     | Right-aligned\n```\n<br>\nWill result in a table like this:\n\nColumn 1 | Column 2 | Column 3\n:--               | :-:               | --:\nLeft-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned\n\n## Images\n```\n![Dicecloud's logo](https://dicecloud.com/favicon-96x96.png)\n```\n![Dicecloud's logo](https://dicecloud.com/favicon-96x96.png)\n\n## Code Blocks\n<pre><code>```\nfunction someCode() {\n  // Useful for displaying blocks of code!\n}\n```</code></pre>\n\n## Inline HTML\nDiceCloud also allows you to use HTML in any text field that allows Markdown. This is an advanced feature, and not all features of HTML are allowed; you should really only use this if you know what you're doing.\n\n---\n<br>\n\n<p style=\"float:left\"><a href=\"/docs/getting-started/using-libraries\">&lt; Previous: Using Libraries</a></p>",

Treated as 1 if unset.\n\n### Condition\nA true/false condition formula that must return `true` for the property to fill a slot. Ignored if unset.\n\n### Condition error text\nText to be displayed as a reason when the property's Condition returns `false`. The formula in Condition is shown instead if unset.\n\n### Library Tags\n[Tags](/docs/concepts/tags) that can be used to find and distinguish the property while in a library. These are used instead of the Tags field when filling slots or searching with the (+) button.",

    "description": "Most properties on DiceCloud fall into one of two categories: static or activated. Static properties are those which stay active on the sheet and have a continuous effect, whereas activated properties only affect the sheet when they're a child of an activated Action, Spell, or Trigger.\n\n---\n\n## Action Properties\nAction properties are a special type of static property that, given some type of input, can trigger activated properties. They form the core of DiceCloud's action system, and activated properties have no effect on the sheet without being triggered by an action property.\n\n**Types of Action Properties**\n- [Actions](/docs/property/action) - activated by clicking the respective button on the Actions tab\n- [Spells](/docs/property/spell) - activated by casting the spell from the Spells tab\n- [Triggers](/docs/property/trigger) - activated automatically upon customizable conditions\n\n---\n\n## Static Properties\nStatic properties make up the bulk of a DiceCloud sheet. They form all of the content of a sheet which is \"always accessible\" or \"always active\", as well as anything that changes without an Action, Spell, or Trigger being activated.\n\n**Types of Static Properties**\n- [Attributes](/docs/property/attribute)\n- [Classes](/docs/property/class)\n- [Class levels](/docs/property/class-level)\n- [Constants](/docs/property/constant)\n- [Containers](/docs/property/container)\n- [Damage multipliers](/docs/property/damage-multiplier)\n- [Effects](/docs/property/effect)\n- [Features](/docs/property/feature)\n- [Folders](/docs/property/folder)\n- [Items](/docs/property/item)\n- [Notes](/docs/property/note)\n- [Point buys](/docs/property/point-buy)\n- [Proficiencies](/docs/property/proficiency)\n- [Skills](/docs/property/skill)\n- [Slots](/docs/property/slot)\n- [Spell lists](/docs/property/spell-list)\n- [Toggles](/docs/property/toggle)\n\n---\n\n## Activated Properties\nActivated properties are used by DiceCloud's action system to implement behavior for Actions, Spells, and Triggers. They only affect your sheet when their parent action is activated.\n\n**Types of Activated Properties**\n- [Attribute damage](/docs/property/attribute-damage)\n- [Branches](/docs/property/branch)\n- [Damage](/docs/property/damage)\n- [Remove buffs](/docs/property/remove-buff)\n- [Rolls](/docs/property/roll)\n- [Saving throws](/docs/property/saving-throw)\n\n---\n\n## Buffs\nIn many cases, it's desirable for an action to temporarily cause some static behavior. This is where the [Buff](/docs/property/buff) property comes in - it bridges the gap between activated and static properties. When activated, a Buff will create a copy of itself outside of its parent action, and any of its static children will become active. For example, an action that grants 10 temporary hit points would most likely use a Buff containing an Effect.\n\nOnce activated, a Buff will remain active until manually removed or targeted by a Remove Buff property.\n\n---\n\n## Activated Behavior of Static Properties\nAs a general rule, properties are either static or activated, and do nothing in the other context. However, there are some properties that, though normally static, do have special behavior when activated.\n\n- Nested Actions and Spells will activate as if manually clicked.\n- Notes will add their title, summary, and description to the action's log output.\n- Toggles will behave like Branches set to \"If condition is true\" mode. <span style=\"opacity:0.5\">[Deprecated]</span>",

By using references, you can avoid duplicating created library properties that need to be commonly reused, and thus also avoid having to edit them in multiple places to make changes.\n\nWhen a reference is added to a sheet, whether via slot or the (+) button, it will be replaced by a copy of the property it links to. Any children of the reference will become children of the copied property as well, which allows for a level of abstraction by creating multiple references with different children.\n\nReferences cannot be created on a character sheet and will be automatically replaced when added from a library. ~~The only way a reference can exist on a sheet is if its linked property no longer exists; in this case, the reference property will continue to exist and serve as an error message.~~ (This behavior is currently bugged; broken references will not be added to the sheet and their child properties will be added to the referenced property's intended parent's children instead.)\n\n---\n\n### Linked Property\nThe property to be copied by the reference when inserted.",
